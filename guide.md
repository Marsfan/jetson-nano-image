# Create your own image for jetson nano board

## Introduction

\_Note: This guide is copied from [https://pythops.com/post/create-your-own-image-for-jetson-nano-board](https://pythops.com/post/create-your-own-image-for-jetson-nano-board) so that it is still readable in the event that site goes down.
I made a few minor alterations to the guide to make it display right in markdown, and to fix some issues I had with the
guide.


This article will guide you step by step to create a minimalist Ubuntu based image for your NVIDIA Jetson nano board that best suits your project.

_Note: The files in this repository are currently optimized for L4T R32.4.4 on the Jetson Nano 2GB. Getting them to work on 
other versions of L4T will likely require fiddling._

## Why would you build an image from scratch instead of using the official one ?

First, for fun. It's always interesting to build stuff from scratch as you always learn something in the process. Second, the official image is large in size (over 5GB ðŸ˜±) and it's filled with lot of unnecessary preinstalled packages (ubuntu-desktop, browser â€¦) that takes lot of disk space and memory.
So, let's create a clean and minimalist image.

## Download the scripts

Before starting, let's first clone the repository where I put all the needed scripts.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pythops/jetson-nano-image
$ cd jetson-nano-image
```

## Create a rootfs

We're gonna use the script `create-rootfs.sh` to create a basic rootfs.
First, we define the location where we want to build it. This is done by defining the environment variable `$JETSON_ROOTFS_DIR`. The path will be created if it does not exit.

```bash
$ export JETSON_ROOTFS_DIR=/path/to/rootfs
```

Then we build the rootfs by running the following command

```bash
$ sudo -E ./create-rootfs.sh
ROOTFS_DIR: ~/jetson-rootfs
Installing the dependencies...  [OK]
Creating rootfs directory...    [OK]
Downloading the base image...   [OK]
Run debootstrap first stage...  [OK]
Run debootstrap second stage... [OK]
Success!
```

_Note: -E option for sudo preserve the environment variables_

## Customize

Now that we have a basic rootfs, we're gonna customize it using one of my favorite tool ever: `Ansible`.
For this step you need to have Ansible installed in your workstation. if it's not the case, just run this command and you're ready to go

```bash
$ sudo apt install ansible
```

This Ansible role is going to do 3 things:

- Install some basic tools (ssh, systemd, sudo â€¦)
- Setup basic configurations (locales, network â€¦)
- Add new user: pythops

You can run the playbook as follows

```bash
$ cd ansible
$ sudo -E $(which ansible-playbook) jetson.yaml
```

Feel free to adapt this role to your needs.

## Create the image

Now that we customized the rootfs, we're gonna use the script `create-image.sh` to create our final image.
We need to define a build directory using the environment variable `$JETSON_BUILD_DIR`. This path will be created if it does not exist.

Because nvidia is a pain in the rear, you can no longer use wget to download the L4T data files. 
instead, you must download the most recent L4T image and place it in the top level directory and pass the file 
in as the first arguemnt in create-image.sh


```bash
$ export JETSON_BUILD_DIR=/path/to/build_dir
```

Then we build the image as follows

```bash
$ sudo -E ./create-image.sh filename
```
_note: filename is the .tbz2 file with the L4T images._ 

If all goes well, you'll get this message at the end

```bash
Image created successfully
Image location: /path/to/jetson.img
```

_note: If you get errors about unmet dependencies, add them to `ansible/roles/jetson/tasks/main.yml`
under both the `Install Nvidia deps` task and the `Mark Nvidia deps` task, 
then go back to [Customize](##Customize) and resume from there.

_note: `apt-mark` is not strictly necessary, but without it, any package dependenceies 
that later become unneeded will not be removed by `apt-get autoremove`_

## Flash on the sdcard

Finally we're gonna flash the image on the sdcard using the script `flash-image.sh`.

Insert your sdcard and run this command

```bash
$ sudo ./flash-image.sh /path/to/jetson.img /dev/mmcblk0
.
.
.
Success !
Your sdcard is ready !
```

_Note: the sdcard path /dev/mmcblk0 may be different in your system._

This script will automatically resize the root partition to occupy all the available space in the sdcard.

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ Now you can boot your board with the new image !

## Nvidia Libraries

To install nvidia libraries (cuda, libcudnn, tensorRT â€¦) you need to use [nvidia sdk manager](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-sdk-manager).

_note: To get the SDK manager working on Ubuntu 20.04, do the following (from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Lauszus/28f546d4f30ce5103b49a7550f3e4975))_

```bash
# Put in "/usr/lib/os-release-bionic"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="18.04 (Bionic Beaver)"
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 18.04"
VERSION_ID="18.04"
VERSION_CODENAME=bionic
UBUNTU_CODENAME=bionic

# Now launch the sdkmanager:
# $ export LSB_OS_RELEASE=/usr/lib/os-release-bionic
# $ sdkmanager
```

## Result

The new image is much smaller, and uses a lot less RAM, as it is not running a GUI.
